<p><h4>when we campose music we use flip theory also we can find it as two major scale we use .when we campose music we flip the triangle of harmony as we need to fit the flow. 
how much is this important things .
like we say we have two sides of Brian emotional and logical . maybe some one tell you we use minors scales for emotional melody . it is if this is your test . this shap as clock turn if your magnetic failed on reverse your test well be different !! .<br>
not always triangle mean trinity's 
augmented chord is trinity, but if you are familiar with music theory in play chord ,we use augmented as pass chord .
in pray we always looking for rights augmented .for right trinity state 3 equals strings ,also it is pass state for foundation of the pray . like meditation . whoever's major and minor is not a pass trinity it is life mode . when we go deeper in this we can rise our concessions and fix our mood.
